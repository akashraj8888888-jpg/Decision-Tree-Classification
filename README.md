Decision Tree Classification is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
It works by splitting the dataset into subsets based on feature values using decision rules.
Each internal node represents a feature, and each leaf node represents a class label.
The model uses measures like Gini Index or Entropy to choose the best splits.
Decision Trees are easy to understand, interpret, and visualize.
